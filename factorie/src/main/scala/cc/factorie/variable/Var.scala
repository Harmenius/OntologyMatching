// Notes on class names for variables:
// "*Variable" are classes and mutable.
// "*Var" are trait counterparts, not yet committing to (im)mutability.
// Many but not all "*Var" traits do not yet commit to a value-storage mechanism.

// Some classes have a "bound" Value type member; others have an "assigned" (concrete, fixed) Value type member
// "*Variable" classes have assigned Value type
// "*Var" traits have bound Value type members
// "*VarWithValue[Foo]" traits Value type member assigned to Foo
// *Variables that are used as type arguments to Family and Template must have assigned Values in order for the Template to work
// because they must implement methods (such as statistics(Variable1#Value)) that concretely define Value.


/**Abstract superclass of all variables.  Don't need to know its value type to use it.
   <p>
   You should never make a Var a Scala 'case class' because then
   it will get hashCode and equals methods dependent on its
   constructor arguments; but the FACTORIE library depends on being
   able to distinguish individual Var instances based on their
   machine address (i.e. System.identityHashCode).
   <p>
   Similarly no Var should ever inherit from scala.collection.Iterable,
   even though its value may do so.  This prevents confusion between
   Model.factors(Var) and Model.factors(Iterable[Var]).
