/** The "domain" of a variable---a representation of all of its values, each having type 'ValueType'.
    This most generic superclass of all Domains does not provide much functionality.
    Key functionality of subclasses:
    DiscreteVectorDomain have a dimensionDomain:DiscreteDomain,
     providing a size and DiscreteValue objects.
    DiscreteDomain extends DiscreteVectorDomain, having single value members: DiscreteValue;
     it is its own dimensionDomain.
    CategoricalDomain provides a densely-packed mapping between category values and integers.
