       a step is found that increases the value significantly (according
       to a threshold from Numerical Recipes).  ConjugateGradient
       assumes that line maximization finds something close
       to the maximum in that direction.  In tests, sometimes the
       direction suggested by CG points downhill.  Consequently, here I am
       setting the search direction to the gradient if the slope is
       negative or 0. */
