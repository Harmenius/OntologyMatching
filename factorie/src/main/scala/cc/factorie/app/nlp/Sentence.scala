/** A span of Tokens making up a sentence within a Section of a Document.
    A Sentence is a special case of a TokenSpan, stored in its Section, and available through the Section.sentences method.
    From the Sentence you can get its sequence of Tokens, the Section that contains it, and the Document that contains it.
    Sentences can be added (in order) to a Section, but not removed from a Section.
    The index of this Sentence into the sequence of Sentences in the Section is available as 'Sentence.indexInSection'.
    The annotation ParseTree is stored on a Sentence.
    Unlike other TokenSpans, constructing a Sentence automatically add it to its Sections.
