// Factor Templates are able to create factors in a factor graph on-the-fly as necessary.
// A factor template specifies:
// (1) a description of the arbitrary relationship among its variable neighbors
// (2) a sufficient statistics function that maps those neighbors to the statistics necessary to return a real-valued score
// (3) an aggregator for multiple statistics of the same template
// (4) a function mapping those aggregated statistics to a real-valued score
// (5) optionally, the parameters used in the function to calculate that score;
//     (alternatively the score may be calculated using parameter stored externally to the Template,
//      or in some fixed way without learned parameters).

// Future, discussed with Sebastian:
// class SymbolicTemplate extends NeighborAwareTemplate[SymbolicPredicate] 
// Term (e.g. real-valued term), tree-based expression, sub-expressions
//  depends on notion of state: each template/term takes a state and maps to double-valued score
// SymbolicPredicate, SymbolicConstant, LogicalGroundAtom extends BooleanVariable with Seq[SymbolicConstant]



/** A template for creating Factors.  The creation of Factors is keyed by neighboring variables. 
    Superclass of Template1, Template2, Template3, Template4.

    Its subclasses use "unroll*" methods, which given on of the Factor's variables, finding the other neighboring variables.
    The "unroll(Var)" method here can be used (or overridden in subclasses) to return Factors keyed by non-neighbor variables.
