/**
 * A solver for weighted bipartite matching, also known as the assignment problem.
 *
 * This does not use the Hungarian algorithm; instead it uses the augmenting paths
 * algorithm which works by finding in sequence a best matching with one edge, a
 * best matching with two edges, etc, until it find a best matching with maximal
 * size. Then it goes back and returns the best overall matching out of those.
 *
 * Transforming the best matching with n nodes into the best matching with n+1 nodes
 * is done by finding the best augmenting path: define a new graph with a source
 * connected with zero weight edges to the unmatched nodes on the "left" side of the
 * matching, and likewise a target connected to the unmatched nodes on the right side.
 * For the bipartite graph, have the edges in the matching have positive weight equal
 * to their cost and going from right to left, while edges not in the matching have
 * negative weights equal to their costs and go from left to right.
 *
 * Then a shortest path from the source to target will necessarily add one edge to the
 * matching for each edge it removes, and add one more edge than that.
 *
 * To see a proof of this algorithm see the lecture notes in
 * http://compgeom.cs.uiuc.edu/~jeffe/teaching/algorithms/2009/notes/18-maxflowext.pdf
 *
 * Note that we can't use Dijkstra for shortest-paths because of the negative-weighted
 * edges. We can't have negatively weighted cycles because the existence of such a
 * cycle would imply that the current state is not a maximal matching with its size.
 *
 * This is useful for implementing the CEAF evaluation metrics in coreference
 * resolution, which assign scores between pairs of truth and returned entities and
 * define the precision and recall of a clustering as a function of the best
 * possible matching between truth and returned clusters.
