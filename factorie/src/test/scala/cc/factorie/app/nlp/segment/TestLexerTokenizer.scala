      I got bored of the iPhone. This has been a conundrum for for the past few months. I wanted a new phone, but didn't know how to transcend away from the iOS environment. I woke up one morning, and said, "whatever, I don't care anymore," and walked into BestBuy(save the hate, I had a $25 coupon and $35 gift card) and bought the Note 2. I have been wanting this phone since I first hear about it.

      Why I made this decision. I love tech stuff, and the iphone, to me, was getting boring. My early upgrade just came through, so I could test a new phone, and still be within the launch period of the next gen iPhone. Having gone from the iPhone 3G, to Iphone4, to the 4S, you would think I would be drawn to the iPhone5 right? No. It did nothing for me. I don't even know how to explain it.

      These are some things that worried me about switching. I have a Mac, and though I use Windows7 on BC, I still want my phone to sync natively to my Mac. The worry that syncing wouldn't be as smooth as the iPhone had me. I don't think there's another phone in existence that syncs info as well as the iPhone on an Mac. I had gotten used to easily syncing EVERYTHING in one go with Itunes and iPhoto, but I decided to just go with it and use it as an experience.

      Now that I actually own the Note 2, and more specifically an Android phone, I actually have a better understanding of the OS quality provided by Apple.
      However, with that said, the Android 4.1 is awesome. Better than anything to come before it from Android(obviously, right?). This phone is an absolute MONSTER!

      I now use my iphone as an alarm clock and is the bluetooth source to play music in my car.

        President F.W. de Klerk released the ANC men -- along with one of the founding members of the Pan Africanist Congress, a rival liberation group --
        as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution
        aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government.  But Pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this
        racially divided country.  As other repressive governments, particularly Poland and the Soviet Union, have recently discovered, initial steps to open
        up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult, if not impossible, to control.  As the days go by, the South African
        government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and
        enforcement of the state of emergency.  If it does n't yield on these matters, and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC, the expectations
        and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest.  If it does, the large number of right-wing whites, who
        oppose any concessions to the black majority, will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands.  The newly released ANC
        leaders also will be under enormous pressure.  The government is watching closely to see if their presence in the townships leads to increased anti-government
        protests and violence; if it does, Pretoria will use this as a reason to keep Mr. Mandela behind bars.  Pretoria has n't forgotten why they were all
        sentenced to life imprisonment in the first place: for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government.  In addition, the government is figuring
        that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the ANC and between the newly freed leaders and those activists
        who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their imprisonment.  In order to head off any divisions, Mr. Mandela, in a meeting with
        his colleagues before they were released, instructed them to report to the ANC headquarters in Lusaka as soon as possible.  The men also will be faced
        with bridging the generation gap between themselves and the country 's many militant black youths, the so-called young lions who are anxious to see
        the old lions in action.  Says Peter Mokaba, president of the South African Youth Congress: `` `` We will be expecting them to act like leaders
        of the ANC. ''  They never considered themselves to be anything else.  At last night 's rally, they called on their followers to be firm,
        yet disciplined, in their opposition to apartheid.  `` `` We emphasize discipline because we know that the government is very, very sensitive, '' said
        Andrew Mlangeni, another early Umkhonto leader who is now 63.  `` `` We want to see Nelson Mandela and all our comrades out of prison, and if we are n't
        disciplined we may not see them here with us.
